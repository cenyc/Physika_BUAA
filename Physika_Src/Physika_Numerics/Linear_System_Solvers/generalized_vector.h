 * GeneralizedVector: base class of linear-system dependent vector types to represent x and b.
 * Derived GeneralizedVector class generally comes along with specific LinearSystem class.
 * A derived example:
 * For a dim-dimensional simulation, A is matrix of size dim*n * dim*n, x and b are vectors of size dim*n,
 * where n is the number of free nodes/particles. With GeneralizedMatrix and GeneralizedVector, the matrix could
 * be defined as matrix of size n*n and vector is a vector of size n whose elements are dim*1 vectors. In this
 * way, we save memory and ease coding by eliminating the need for flatting vectors.

/*
 * RawScalar is defined for float and double
 * the type of raw data in the vector
 *
 * GeneralizedVector makes extensive use of polymorphism,
 * one flaw of this design is that implementation of LinearSystemSolvers
 * becomes a little inconvenient since they don't know the dynamic type of
 * vectors and have to use pointers/references to enable polymorphism.
